---- Notes on inverted distance experiments ----
Scaling doesn't work nicely with ray, now is a good
time to see if promoting "being next to other people"
is a valid tactic

Changed: Empathy replaced by inverted distance to
living agents

Experiments: 3x3, 7x7 , 4m steps

3x3: Trading emerges and increases
7x7: trading doesn't noticable take off after 4m steps
     not obvious if this would be the case given more timesteps
     or bigger window

Experiment: 7x7, 10m steps
Experiment: 5x5, 10m steps
    Suceeds on both
Experiment: 15x15 10m steps
    Trading emerges a bit for player 1 and 2, I think this might be due to
    15x15 being too big for agents to survive all the way until they meet
    another agent, so it's random if they can actually meet or not
