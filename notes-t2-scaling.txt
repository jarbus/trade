---- Notes on Scaling ----
I have this working for small grids (3x3), but
drop mechanic doesn't emerge for larger worlds.
Trying to train on small worlds and see if that
works on large worlds.

Added: serve for trade_v2
Added: lifetime metric, to view lifetime of each player
Fixed: all agents were starting off at (0,0)

"Scale to 15 4m" and "random 4m"
    Goal is to scale to 15x15 trading scenario
    window size 2,2, empathy 1
    scale: grid side = 2*(steps / 500k) + 1
    random: grid side = randint(1, 15)
    batch size = 500
    smaller architecture

    Results: Random fails, scale can't increase grid size
    due to total number of steps getting reset

Added: replaced scaling and empathy with inverted agent distance

Experiment: 3x3, 7x7 with inverted agent distance
