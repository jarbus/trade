---- Notes on new reward experiments ----
reshaping reward so that agents can learn to trade on large maps

agents die if they run out of all food, otherwise they take -1 rew
for each food they are out of, or log(f) for f >= 0.1
return inv_dist reward for each agent

3x3: Confirm that this reward function can work at all
    no
15x15: see if this reward function can work on large maps
    no
agents are somehow getting a sub-ten lifetime mean and plenty of 0 lifetime min

(3, 3): replace log with +1
fails

If this doesn't work, might need to add a penalty for dying,
agents will have incentive to die asap instead of learn to exchange
by dropping their goods.
or maybe just remove dying
or just reward having any amount of food with a +1

or maybe don't do this, the "compute_done" might be more important.
generally speaking, living is good.
agents with 2 foods need to surive longer than agents with one food
do I need three foods?
two foods, food collection

axioms: live as long as possible <--- when should there be death?
- when any of the resources needed are not met
live as good of a life as possible
be social
don't expend too much energy
don't starve

1D: food at edge of map, agents go to collect it, then trade
